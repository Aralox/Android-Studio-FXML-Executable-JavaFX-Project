This was created for me to get help with proper JavaFX project structure in Android Studio.
See my Stack Overflow question:

I've only included the files that I've added or changed, the rest are default.

#Build Instructions
- Create a blank Android project in Android Studio, add a `Java Library` module
 (Detailed instructions here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/26196451/1072869).
- Pull this repo into your project, or copy the files in (name as necessary).
- Create the directory `foo/build/resources/main`, needed (for some reason) for this project to compile.
